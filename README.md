# Spotify_data_analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on Spotify's music data. The goal of this project is to explore trends, identify patterns in musical features, and derive insights into what makes songs popular.

## Overview
Music streaming data provides a rich source of information about listener habits and song characteristics. This project leverages Python and data science libraries to clean, process, and visualize Spotify datasets (likely sourced from Kaggle or the Spotify Web API).

## Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: Numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and plotting.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for analysis.

(Optional: Add Scikit-Learn if you performed any machine learning/clustering)

##  Key Insights & Features
The analysis covers several key aspects of the music data:

1. Correlation Analysis: How features like energy, danceability, and loudness relate to one another.

2. Top Artists/Tracks: Identification of the most popular tracks and artists in the dataset.

3. Temporal Trends: How music characteristics have evolved over the years (e.g., changes in song duration or acousticness).

4. Genre Analysis: Comparison of musical features across different genres.

5. Popularity Prediction: (If applicable) Analysis of which factors contribute most to a song's popularity score.
